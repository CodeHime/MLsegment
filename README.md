#### Abstract

Visual surveillance requires the moving object to be captured and tracked. The basic technique used  
for discriminating moving objects from the static objects is background separation. Background  
separation will subtract the current frame from the reference frame of static objects. This method is  
not capable of handling multiple backgrounds like moving water in a fountain. Hence we have to  
use some other models like unimodal model, MOG, Kernel , CB, etc. for separating those variations.
